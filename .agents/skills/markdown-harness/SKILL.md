name: markdown-harness
description: Govern a folder of markdown with markdown-harness — set it up in a repository, author or change a
  markdown-harness.config.yaml, put `mh --check` in the gate, or wire the Claude Code hook that reads a freshness
  sentence back to an agent. Use when installing or setting up markdown-harness, deciding what a document must declare
  about its provenance or freshness, adding or changing a rule, working out why a rule governs nothing, or demonstrating
  what the tool does.
compatibility: Requires @hancrafted/markdown-harness >= 0.0.2, as `mh` or `npx mh`. Confirm with `mh --help`.

**Being handed this skill is a request to act.** Run the probes, say where the repository stands, and
offer the numbered options for that state — all three in your first reply. A slash command or a file
read putting this in front of you _is_ the request; act on it directly.

Keep the offer to the work in step 3's table. Other governance systems in the repository are a
separate conversation, and listing them alongside turns an answer into a menu.

## 1. Probe

Five reads, one pass, and they settle the corpus between them. Each reads the artifact itself rather
than a record of it, so none can go stale.

| Probe                                            | Absent means   |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `markdown-harness.config.yaml` at the repo root  | not configured |
| `docs/markdown-harness/`                         | init never ran |
| `@hancrafted/markdown-harness` in `package.json` | not installed  |
| the gate script contains `mh --check`            | not gated      |
| a `PostToolUse` entry in `.claude/settings.json` | not hooked     |

## 2. Say where the repository stands

One line, from what the probes found — not a report of five probes. "You have a config and the gate
runs `mh --check`, but nothing is hooked" is the whole of step 2.

A one-line welcome explaining what the tool is belongs **only** in the never-set-up state. Anywhere
else the repository has already answered that question and the user is mid-task.

## 3. Offer the numbered options for that state

| Config  | `docs/markdown-harness/` | State              | Offer                                                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| absent  | absent                   | not set up         | 1. set it up · 2. see it work on throwaway files first                                |
| absent  | present                  | set up, ungoverned | 1. author the first config · 2. see the demo · 3. finish setup                        |
| present | either                   | governed           | 1. add or change a rule · 2. why a rule governs nothing · 3. gate · 4. hook · 5. demo |

**Options are numbered, never bulleted.** That is a house rule for this skill and it holds in
`init.md`, `demo.md` and `authoring-a-config.md` too: a user answering a menu should be able to type
one digit.

## 4. Read the file for the option they picked

| To do this                                                | Read this                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Set it up — install, gate and hook in one pass            | [`assets/init.md`](assets/init.md)                             |
| See it work on throwaway files before committing to rules | [`assets/demo.md`](assets/demo.md)                             |
| Author the first config, or add, change or debug one rule | [`assets/authoring-a-config.md`](assets/authoring-a-config.md) |
| Put `mh --check` in the gate on its own                   | [`assets/wiring-the-gate.md`](assets/wiring-the-gate.md)       |
| Wire the freshness hook on its own, on Claude Code        | [`assets/wiring-the-hook.md`](assets/wiring-the-hook.md)       |

`init.md` covers the last two through a script; reach for them directly when init has already run, or
when the repository needs one without the other. Read the file you picked before acting — each
carries its own steps and its own completion criterion.

## What holds throughout

One config file declares what each path must carry. Rules are an ordered list, the first match is the
complete set of constraints, and a file no rule names is invisible to the tool.

**Governance is opt-in** — a rule that matches nothing governs nothing, and the tool stays silent.
**The tool reports; the user decides.** Propose frontmatter edits, and write what they approve.

**Treat a script's exit 0 as evidence about the script alone.** Where a step claims the freshness
hook works, the evidence is a row in `docs/markdown-harness/activity.csv`. `demo.md` step 4 is the
worked example.

`mh --help` lists the commands and the exit codes. Ask the tool rather than trusting a restatement.
